# De-risking Technology Projects in Government
A guide for governments who plan, budget and oversee agile software projects

## Project description

#### The [De-Risking Technology Project](#project-description)explores how federally funded custom technology projects can benefit from an agile and human centered approach to planning, budgeting and oversight. Putting these approaches into practice lead to better outcomes for US taxpayers and decrease the failure rate of custom IT work - which is typically extraordinarily risky. 

Adapting to this approach involves supporting autonomous agile product teams within government; alongside training for government leadership on how to budget for and provide oversight of Agile software procurement, to reduce wasteful spending of federal technology grants. 

Today, waterfall software development remains standard at all levels of government, Outdated budgeting and oversight processes have been designed around waterfall processes. Moving toward a user-centered, agile approach to this work will prevent millions of dollars in spending on bad software.

After having shown the feasibility of this approach in [two prior phases](#What-weve-done-so-far), we have developed a robust training series and fieldbook for state, local and federal government partners that involves four learning segments. 

## Fieldbook

[blurb about the guidebooks] 

August 2019 “[De-risking custom technology projects for state governments](https://github.com/18F/technology-budgeting/blob/master/handbook.md)”

June 2020 “[De-risking custom technology projects for federal agencies](xxxx)”


## Training Series 
Individual actors working within a larger state system, on an assembly line of funding requests, often lacking the knowledge to evaluate requests for funding for custom software.

We provide training to state budgeting and procurement officials alongside requesting agencies

### What we believe this model can achieve

- **Cost-efficiency:** A federally-built API that can deliver eligibility rules to many state systems at once dramatically reduces the complexity and cost of building and maintaining state systems, because those systems no longer need to build or maintain eligibility rules in their own rules engine product.

- **Reduced risk:** Centralizing eligibility business logic at the federal level provides more flexibility and reduces risk for states who need to modernize their benefits systems. Instead of modernizing an entire massive system in a large risky project, states can strategically disconnect and reconnect pieces of the system gradually, significantly reducing their risk.

- **Integrity:** In this model, program eligibility rules are centrally maintained by the Eligibility API at the federal level. If rules or policy change, those changes can be made at the API level and will propagate out to all connected states automatically. This greatly reduces the risk of state systems being out of sync with federal rules.

- **Transparency:** Because the eligibility rules are written in publicly-available code, people can view them and confirm that systems are behaving as expected. There's no "black box" where eligibility criteria are hidden away; instead, the programatic rules are open to public review.

- **Innovation:** An API is a technique that is widely used within modern digital service design to provide controlled, secure, flexible access to a system's data. Using an API to deliver eligibility rules would create an open canvas for creative technologists and civil servants to come up with exciting and powerful ideas to serve the public that we haven't even thought of yet.

### What we've done so far

This work was founded by Robin Carnahan and Waldo Jaquith, former 18F staff, who are leaders in government innovation. See Waldo's speech to the Michigan State Legislature in 2020 here: XXXX
